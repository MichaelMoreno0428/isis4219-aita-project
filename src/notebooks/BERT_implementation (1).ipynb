They were gone for 1.5 weeks. \\n\\nThey got home yesterday and my dad started accusing me of driving his 1960s porsche and leaving it at friends house. The car is his baby and he\\u2019s the second owner, the first was my grandpa. I\\u2019ve driven it once in my life and it made me so nervous I never wanted to drive it again. I promised him I didn\\u2019t drive it but the car was gone. We called the police and they came out and discovered that the cameras by the garage had been broken. And with ring footage from the neighbors and the data from our cameras the car had been stolen about a week ago. My dad is despondent because I guess the longer a car theft goes the harder it is to find it. I feel so bad.\\n\\nHe\\u2019s so mad at me (my mom is too) because I park my XTerra right next to the Porsche and I did not see that it was gone for the entire week. I should have noticed but I just didn\\u2019t. Obviously we know the date it was stolen and I must have pulled in and out and parked next to the empty spot dozens of times and I just didn\\u2019t notice.\\n\\nI think my dad wants to kick me out. Aita?\",\n          \"Backstory: before I met my husband, he purchased a house for his mother to live in with his tour money from Afghanistan.\\n\\nHis step dad died while he was on tour, no life insurance, they were renters. My husband used his money for a down payment on a house that she would live in and he charged her $1000 a month for the past 14 years.\\n\\nWe have been together for 12, married for 9.  We\\u2019ve paid $200 a month to cover costs not covered by her $1000.  Plus we\\u2019ve paid for all the repairs. She is on title for the house for 1% so she had security of being on title and my husband and I own the remaining 99%.\\n\\nWe have decided to sell the house.  My husband offered for her to buy it way under market value and she said no. So he\\u2019s offered to split the profit with her.  It will end up being $120-150k in her pocket when all is said and done.\\n\\nShe treats my husband like shit, ignores me, doesn\\u2019t ask about our kids or know their birthdates.  She\\u2019s not interested in any part of our lives.  She\\u2019s now telling family my husband is somehow taking advantage of her and he\\u2019s the bad guy.\\n\\nShe was a shitty cold mom and with the way her and his step dad treated my husband he moved out at 14 and lived with his bio dad.\\n\\nShe lives about 3 hrs away and my husband made two trips there before listing to fix things that needed repair.  The yard was no kept nicely (MIL is late 50s but in decent shape, and my 31 yr old BIL lives there) we replaced the roof, repainted, he took all their junk they didn\\u2019t want to the dump.  The whole time he was there she treated him like crap, was negative to him and even had a friend over and didn\\u2019t introduce him.\\n\\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to give her anything? I know she will need it, and if she was even a little bit pleasant I could feel good about it.  It was an arrangement my husband had before me so I\\u2019m going along with his wishes, but I don\\u2019t think she deserves anything.   She\\u2019s always treated him like crap, doesn\\u2019t appreciate how he\\u2019s helped her and he\\u2019s splitting all the profit even though we\\u2019ve paid tons out of pocket.\\n\\nShe\\u2019s always had crappy jobs and just did what she had to with no regard for the future, I guess she just expected my husband to foot the bill for her lifestyle? But not her 3 other sons.  Was it not his step fathers job to make sure she was taken care of?\\n\\nIf you read this far thanks.\",\n          \"Long story short,  my 7yo nephew Cain and I have been spending a lot of time together. My brother and Cain's mom deal with some issues. I do have a 17yo son (Lex) and WFH so I have a lot of spare time. \\n\\nI love having Cain because I get to be a little kid dad again. Lex doesn't seem to mind that Cain basically lives here. Yesterday I took him shopping at Target and he asked me if he could this quad drone. I said I had a better idea. You can have Lex's old drone which bigger! We just need batteries because Lex hasn't used it in like 8 years. \\n\\nThen it hit me why not give Cain all of Lex's old toys. Legos, action figures, games, etc all collecting dust in the closet. Cain was so happy about it.\\n\\nWhile I was giving Cain a bath, Cain was playing with some of Lex's toy cars, Lex came into the bathroom and told Cain to pit back his toys  when he's done. Lex was annoyed that Cain was using his toys.\\n\\nI told Cainto ignore Lex and I'll talk to him. After I put Cain to bed, I told Lex that I gave Cain his toys. Lex said to stop and put his stuff back. I said that he's 17yo and has not touched his old toys in like 8 years. So what if I give them to Cain.\\n\\nLex said it was still his. I said yes, but you're 17. You don't play with toys anymore. It's fine to let other kids use them. It's not like I took stuff out of his room.

My (24f) father passed away when I was 17. It was a tough time for my family and I, but we eventually moved on. 3 years later, my mother decided to remarry. I was hesitant about it at first, but I wanted my mother to be happy, so I tried to give her new husband a chance. The point is: living with this guy is unbearable, and it seems that my mother has followed the same path as him.\\n\\nHowever, my grandparents, who are extremely wealthy and have always loved me very much, always hated him and tried convincing my mother to not marry him. They had various reasons for this, and even after my half-siblings were born, their feelings towards him never changed. My mother's new family is financially irresponsible and they always assumed that they will inherit my grandparents' entire estate, so they are taking advantage and making excessive expenses, to the point of getting into debt.\\n\\nRecently, my grandparents called me over to their house for a personal talk. While we were having dinner, they told me that I will inherit the majority of the estate and my mother will receive only a ridiculous amount. They asked me to promise not to say anything to my mother, and I did as they asked. I feel guilty about this because my mother's family will end up in financial ruin because they are counting on money that doesn't exist.\\n\\nSo, AITA?\",\n          \"AITA for not moving out of a photo spot?

He asked me if I can move away \\\"for only 2 minutes\\\" so that he can take a video of the sunset. I want to add that he was not very nice. He was talking with a very annoyed attitude.\\n\\nI told him that the pool is empty and that he can come in the water and go to the edge to have a good view and no people will be on his picture but I guess he did not want to get in the water.\\n\\nHe then said something like \\\"I am asking you polelitely to move away\\\". But he was not polite at all and was almost yelling.\\n\\nHonestly, I could have moved away for a couple minutes but I decided to ignore him because I felt a little bullied and did not want to give in.
