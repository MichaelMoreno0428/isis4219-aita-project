         "My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \n\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\nI told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

You need to do what is right for your immediate family before it puts even more strain on your relationship.\\n\\nI think you need to get them to leave before it gets worse. It doesnt take much imagination to see how it could.\\n\\nHow uncomfortable do you have to be in your own home before something snaps? This is not a tenable situation. You have a right to feel safe /comfortable in your own home and anyone that militates against that is playing a dangerous game.', \"NTA. \\nNormal behaviour is asking to borrow stuff and respecting a persons decision if they say no.\\nYou don't walk into other people's rooms without permission, 'borrowing' without asking is Stealing. \\n\\nAnd good on you for standing by your daughter.

They have their dad with them.', 'NTA. As someone who had a “family friend” move into our house “temporarily” when I was in middle school. You did the right thing. The “family friend” who moved in with us, was only supposed to be there temporarily, until he got himself an apartment. Lived with us for 4 years. He only moved out because my parents eventually separated and divorced, while he was still living with us. So for the last 4 years that my family, was a family, we had some guy, who my sister and I didnt even like, live in our home. \\n\\nDo yourself and your family a favour and give a timeline that they have to move out by or you will be taken advantage of and it might ruin your marriage.', 'NTA\\n\\nSammy sounds like he is spoiling his daughters and justifying their actions by blaming the victim (Zoey). Kicking them out may be a good idea at this point.', 'NTA. Your wife harbors someone who tells you that Zoey has a \"defect\" in her personality for buying an expensive make up kit,  that\\'s the kind of thing that has people thinking about divorce.', \"NTA. \\n\\nAll teen girls don't steal each other's stuff and ruin it because they've never been taught basic respect. Only asshole teen girls with asshole parents who enable them do this.\\n\\nThey are guests in your home, you haven't adopted them.

How are you going to stay *in my home* and give me the silent treatment?\\n\\nHis daughters are 18 — they are adults. You wife can go with them. Fuck that noise.\", \"NTA, but wow, I'm shocked that your wife cares more about appearances and her brother/nieces than her own daughter. Giving her own child the silent treatment? That's just insane to me. And don't think your daughter hasn't noticed that her mother isn't on her side. That's gotta hurt. Your wife needs to wake up.\", 'NTA - please for the love of god\\n\\nKeep the lock and keep standing with you daughter', 'You did the right thing with the lock. You opened your home to these people and they are disrespecting you and your child. I’m sorry your wife is not on your side, but your first obligation is to protect your daughter and your home, valuables and all. It was a $60 makeup kit this time, next time it will be worse. \\n\\nThe cousins are not your daughters and you don’t owe any of them the right to take, use, and destroy any of your family’s belongings. Hopefully they will take the hint and leave as soon as possible. But you did nothing wrong and I hope eventually your wife will understand that. \\n\\nNTA.', \"NTA. \\n\\nThey are disregarding her boundaries after repeatedly being told what these boundaries are. You have allowed her to enforce these boundaries in the only way that seems to work with them.\\n\\nAs a female myself I know that the make up I use is some of the most expensive due to serious skin issues (allergies and dermatitis) so I don't share and have never shared my make up one of the quickest ways to get an infection is using someone else's eye make up or mascara. Thank you for having your daughter's back and showing her that no she is not being a bad person by asking for and enforcing boundaries\", 'NTA You’re being a great dad in a ridiculous situation.

Them offer to replace the lock with a surveillance camera.\", 'NTA. The cousins aren’t borrowing. They are stealing. Borrowing is when you ask permission for something and then return it in the same condition in which it was given.  Saying that your daughter should not be spending so much money on makeup is just a distraction/deflection from the fact that they they took her property and ruined it. \\n\\nAs far as the lock…it is not keeping cousins from spending time together because clearly they are entering the room when your daughter isn’t even there. \\n\\nThese are all deflections from the fact the his daughters are thieves.', 'NTA. Borrowing requires permission. They are entering her private space and removing her personal items without permission. Which is the basics of breaking and entering so your BIL might want to work on their personality flaws. \\n\\nThis is your house and your rule is that they may not go in your daughter’s room and take things.

Teenagers deserve the right to privacy and security and it sounds like your wife doesn't fully understand that. As long as Zoey is responsible with how she keeps her electronics tidy (fire hazard), doesn't do drugs, and doesn't have any dangerous mental health issues, she deserves that lock.\", \"NTA at all for putting a lock on the door. Something is seriously wrong with the cousins and those excusing them from taking your daughter's things. I have two sisters. We were teenagers at the same time for a few years. None of us 'borrowed' something from another without asking. It would never even occur to us and is not normal teenage girl behavior.\", 'NTA- but you need to kick them out and prioritise your daughter', 'NTA\\n\\nSharing makeup is gross. If they had pink eye.

I hope you do kick them out. \\n\\nCan you go to BIL room and just start grabbing stuff off his and using it?', 'NTA. This is not typical teenager behavior unless they have been poorly raised without learning respect for the belongings of others. If you \"borrow\" something, it is with the permission of the person who owns the item. These girls are terrible guests and should not be allowed to help themselves to anything OP\\'s daughter has in *her* room. She is also a teenager who needs her privacy.

You need to protect Zoey.  \\n\\n1. Your wife is T A for continuously dismissing Zoey’s feelings and letting Zoey be hurt repeatedly.  Your wife is choosing her brother over Zoey.  She’s also enabling the cousins’ behaviour by having no repercussions for their STEALING.  Your wife is destroying Zoey’s mental health and their relationship.\\n\\n2. BIL is T A.  He’s selfish, entitled, and a bully.  It’s obvious why no one would take him in.  He puts his feelings above everyone else’s and enables his daughter’s stealing.  He’s a bad parent and uncle.\\n\\n3. The cousins are T A for stealing and then throwing a fit when they can’t steal anymore.  They are not borrowing.  They are stealing and destroying property.\\n\\nPlease do the following:\\n\\n1. Tell Zoey you love her, support her, and will keep her safe.\\n\\n2. Tell her that her Mom, uncle, and cousins are all the wrong and that she did nothing to deserve this behaviour.\\n\\n3. Tell Zoey that her privacy matters and she is right not to give her cousins anything that they want.\\n\\n4. Tell Zoey that you’re going to leave the house with her or kick out BIL.  Either way, you’re going to keep her away from them.\\n\\n5. Tell her how proud you are of her working and saving for her makeup.  Surprise with a gift card so she buy a new and some more.  \\n\\n6.

The ball is in their court at that point.\\n\\nEdited to add: NTA\\n\\nYou\\'re a good dad, trying to protect your daughter.', 'NTA - you are doing your BIL and his kids a favor by letting them stay with you in the first place so they should be going above and beyond to show you and your wife and kid respect. Your daughter very clearly needs someone on her side in this situation, keep being there for her.', \"NTA\\n\\nYour wife's family seems to be lively! They have no respect for your boundaries.\", 'Nta tell everyone that if they keep up with the silent treatment in your own home to yourself and daughter, then they better start packing up their stuff and staying elsewhere.   No one treats you and your family poorly under your own roof.', 'NTA - But your problem is with your wife. Your BIL shouldn\\'t have any opinion at all about how you run the house he\\'s currently living in for free. I highly suggest you kick them out, and if your wife has a problem with that, I suggest she go with them. And that is not \"teen stuff.\" It\\'s people with zero morals/ethics/standards stuff. Not what I\\'d want around my daughter.', 'NTA\\n\\nNieces, BIL, and also, sadly, the wife of OP, are the AHs.\\n\\nThis particularly sticks in my craw:\\n\\n\\'\\'my wife shamed me....saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters...\"\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nThey are not his daughters. I think people often go wrong by starting with a proposition that isn\\'t true, but, supposedly, under some ideal set of conditions, perhaps should be true. This isn\\'t even a \"blended family\"/step sibling situation, so why the conflation?\\n\\nThese girls are his nieces, not his daughters, and the fact that they are now living in his house doesn\\'t change that. OP and his wife do not have the responsiblity for raising these girls, BIL does. And OP and wife don\\'t have the authority that goes with that, either. Perhaps, if all three girls WERE sisters, OP and wife could find some other way to deal with this, that doesn\\'t involve locking doors against theft within a household. But OP and his wife really have only indirect authority over the nieces, through the BIL, if at all. And given the attitude of BIL, even that is dubious.\\n\\nThe girls should be treated exactly as what they are. Cousins that are staying at the house, most likely on a temporary basis. They should be treated with respect, of course, but it is not disrespectful to lock them out of a room from which they are habitually stealing, apparently with their father\\'s OK. Really, as the OP makes clear in his last par, they, and BIL, are lucky this is all that he is doing.', 'NTA, as a teenage girl myself I totally understand your daughters frustration, what the twin girls are doing is not okay. The fact that the uncle was claiming that you were the enabler is strange to me, he is literally letting his kids ruin your daughters stuff, some of which she worked hard to pay for.', \"NTA. But you married into trash and now it's all over your house.\", \"NTA, it's *Your* home dude.\", 'NTA if they cant respect privacy then a locks the awnser simple as that', 'NTA I have a sister and when one of us took another’s belongings without asking, we got in big trouble. Because that’s stealing. And when my sis ruined something of mine once, my dad shut down sharing till she could learn to be more respectful of other peoples things because he felt she was super irresponsible in ruining it. You are awesome giving your daughter privacy, and your BIL has some major balls coming into your home, demanding things, and disrespecting your parenting as he spoils his brats. No wonder he’s divorced, sounds like a pill.', \"NTA - why is your wife enabling such obnoxious behaviour from her brother and his sticky fingered little offspring? Why are the kids with him and not his previous partner? not that they should be - I'm just being nosey.\", 'NTA\\nThey aren’t borrowing and they absolutely know it’s wrong. They have no respect for your daughter or her belongings.  There’s nothing wrong with your daughter to save up for something she wants.  It’s also pretty gross using someone else’s makeup.  \\n\\nI’d expect the two eighteen year olds to pay for Mac kit they destroyed and to tell your brother in law the demand is coming from you, not your daughter.  \\n\\nDon’t remove that lock!  Also might want to get a locking makeup bag for your daughter.', 'NTA. Makeup should never be shared due to possible contamination.  Nobody wants pink eye spreading around the household.  \\n\\nSharing and borrowing WITH PERMISSION is one thing.  Walking in and just swiping stuff? Oh hell naw.  \\n\\nYou go, Dad.', 'Okay, so I see several issues here. And you\\'re NTA in all of them.\\n\\n* Regarding the lock, you absolutely did the right thing for getting it, and you\\'re doing the right thing in making sure it stays there.\\n* Regarding the lock part 2 and your nieces now being unable to spend time with your daughter (according to your wife), I presume the lock is only locked when Zoey is out of her room? So, how does your nieces ability to enter your daughter\\'s room when she\\'s not there impact their ability to spend time with her? Not at all, that\\'s how much. Your wife is an AH for trying to blame-shifting here. But then, blame-shifting and victim-blaming seem to run in the family, don\\'t they? Because that\\'s what your BIL did by declaring your daughter shouldn\\'t have the make-up in the first place that his daughter ruined.\\n* Regarding not having your wife\\'s back, you\\'re still doing the right thing. Because she should have her daughter\\'s back, which you do. She\\'s clearly in the wrong here. However, you need to have a serious talk with your wife. About how badly your BIL\\'s and nieces\\' presence in your home impacts you, your daughter, and your relationship with your wife. I mean, her giving you and your daughter the silent treatment for protecting her(self) and her belongings is very high up there in the realms of unreasonalbe, if not toxic.\\n* If your wife stays unreasonable and \"upset\" with you, I\\'d seriously suggest that you make sure your nieces know where your wife keeps her make-up, her jewellery, phone cases and whatever else they may be interested in. I\\'m pretty sure she\\'ll sing a different tune pretty quickly. Especially if you make sure she can\\'t use your common money (household money or the like), but only her personal spending money to replace the stuff your nieces steal/destroy.', 'NTA at all.  I grew up with sisters that stole and destroyed everything I owned.  I went a whole New England winter without boots because one sister had stolen mine and was hiding them in her school locker.  I’d walk in their room and my cd’s would be snapped in half on their floor.  Their friends would come over wearing my clothes... after they had modified them by cutting off the hood or something.  Etc etc but tell your wife:  I no longer talk to my sisters or my parents.  Just my side of things.  Even if I liked them I wouldn’t be able to afford the losses of their unmitigated assholery.', \"NTA...I feel bad for your daughter.  BIL and nieces have no respect for you, your daughter or your property.  Shows lack of parenting if they don't understand boundaries of other people's property. Unfortunately at 18, they'll never get it. As a woman, your wife should understand the need for privacy.  He should be finding a way to get himself and his grown daughters their own place.  So sorry you have to deal with this.  It also sounds like the twins are jealous of what your daughter has.\", 'Good luck, your wife and her family sounds like a bunch of narcissists.']",

         "META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world",
         "I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",

You don\\'t generally have those questions unless there is *something* you could have done differently.  Even if you\\'re not \"the asshole\".

I dont like that person so please treat them like shit\".', 'I think theres a reason this sub is called \"am i the asshole?\" And not \"do i have the right to do this?\" \\n\\nBecause \"The Asshole\"(tm) is a person you meet who does something rude, maybe they had a reason, but they become the asshole when they break politeness rules. Exeptions should be made when you hear the context, but im glad someone voiced this opinion about this sub', \"I agree, that this sub focuses more on excuses as to why a person shouldn't be the asshole for generally shitty behavior and kind of completely ignores social norms.\", \"Thanks for writing this post.

         "UPDATE, AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?",
         "I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",

He has a twin brother and they even interviewed him. Maybe you would want to check it out.\\n\\nSorry your parents have been behaving as they have been. \", 'Hi OP,\\n\\nLet me start by telling you that your feelings are completely legitimate, understandable, and NTA.\\n\\nI am the youngest of four kids; my oldest brother (R) is severely special-needs and we have grown up helping to take care of him.  My mom had R at 17 years old, and for a baby that wasn’t expected to make it past 8 years old, he’s now going on 34 because of the love and care we all devoted to him.\\n\\nI love my family. I love my brother with all that I am. I will be there for him until the day I die. All of this is because my family is a *unit*, because it is *our own choice* to make sure he’s happy and healthy. Let me tell you, it isn’t easy: it’s taken me 10 years to be able to get ahold of my anxiety when he has a seizure, for instance. I still struggle, but I’m happy to help and learn and talk to people about it along the way.\\n\\nMy parents - for our entire lives - worked around *our* schedules.  If we had gymnastics or softball or a choir concert, one parent would take turns to stay home and the other would go attend. They would ask us “what are your plans tonight?” And if we didn’t have any, they would kindly ask if they could go out to dinner or a movie or anything and can we take care of R for a couple hours? Which we are all happy to do. If we have plans, then they’ll say “Ok, go and have fun!” It wasn’t like “You need to do this and you need to be here for him.” \\n\\nI now “work” for my brother through the State, and am licensed to provide the care he needs. Because I want to if my parents can’t someday.\\n\\nThat’s the difference here, OP. I made the choice to be there, to take care of him when my parents need a break. But I also have the choice to say no. And you should have had that choice too. Let me tell you, **it’s not for everybody and that’s okay.**\\n\\nLet me repeat that:\\n\\n##Taking care of another human being - especially one that has special needs - is not for everybody, *and that’s okay*.\\n\\nIf any one of us kids didn’t want that responsibility, we would have gotten a home care provider through the many many resources my State offers for people who need it. I’m talking about the good home care aides and nurses who wake up every day and say “I get to see my patient today;“I can’t wait to spend time with so-and-so tonight”. The ones who went to training took the time to get educated, licensed, and signed up with the understanding that they’d be helping take care of someone where others can’t.\\n\\nSo knowing all this, I want you to appreciate the choice you finally got to make **now**. And I want you to be assured that it was the right one for you in this point of your life.\\n\\nI want you to enjoy college, try new things and fail and try again. Find that thing that makes you wake up and say “I can’t wait to do this today”. That’s where you should be because it will be your choice; no guilt, no shame. Go study, grow, learn to do the thing that others weren’t meant to do.\\n\\nKnowing you love your sister and want the absolute best for her - and knowing that you probably aren’t the one to provide that for her - is honestly a very selfless thing; it will save you and her a lot of resentment. But I also hope you are able to forgive your family - the hand they were dealt was a tough one, and I’m sorry they handled it the way they did. That wasn’t your sister’s fault and it wasn’t your fault.\\n\\nI hope this helps bring perspective and some comfort.', 'r/entitledparents r/narcissisticparents jesus christ dude this is not okay man... i wish i could do anything for you', 'How were you put on here to be her caretaker you were born first.

         "AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?",
         "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life.

Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did.

         "I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. \n\nSince I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \n\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. \n\nThat’s it. Take care everyone.",

         "META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world",
         "I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",

         "I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",

There was a [This American Life episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/317/unconditional-love/act-two-4) that came on yesterday where the parents decided to send their autistic son to a facility after many struggles. He has a twin brother and they even interviewed him. Maybe you would want to check it out.\\n\\nSorry your parents have been behaving as they have been. \", 'Hi OP,\\n\\nLet me start by telling you that your feelings are completely legitimate, understandable, and NTA.\\n\\nI am the youngest of four kids; my oldest brother (R) is severely special-needs and we have grown up helping to take care of him.  My mom had R at 17 years old, and for a baby that wasn’t expected to make it past 8 years old, he’s now going on 34 because of the love and care we all devoted to him.\\n\\nI love my family. I love my brother with all that I am. I will be there for him until the day I die. All of this is because my family is a *unit*, because it is *our own choice* to make sure he’s happy and healthy. Let me tell you, it isn’t easy: it’s taken me 10 years to be able to get ahold of my anxiety when he has a seizure, for instance. I still struggle, but I’m happy to help and learn and talk to people about it along the way.\\n\\nMy parents - for our entire lives - worked around *our* schedules.  If we had gymnastics or softball or a choir concert, one parent would take turns to stay home and the other would go attend. They would ask us “what are your plans tonight?” And if we didn’t have any, they would kindly ask if they could go out to dinner or a movie or anything and can we take care of R for a couple hours? Which we are all happy to do. If we have plans, then they’ll say “Ok, go and have fun!” It wasn’t like “You need to do this and you need to be here for him.” \\n\\nI now “work” for my brother through the State, and am licensed to provide the care he needs. Because I want to if my parents can’t someday.\\n\\nThat’s the difference here, OP. I made the choice to be there, to take care of him when my parents need a break. But I also have the choice to say no. And you should have had that choice too. Let me tell you, **it’s not for everybody and that’s okay.**\\n\\nLet me repeat that:\\n\\n##Taking care of another human being - especially one that has special needs - is not for everybody, *and that’s okay*.\\n\\nIf any one of us kids didn’t want that responsibility, we would have gotten a home care provider through the many many resources my State offers for people who need it. I’m talking about the good home care aides and nurses who wake up every day and say “I get to see my patient today;“I can’t wait to spend time with so-and-so tonight”. The ones who went to training took the time to get educated, licensed, and signed up with the understanding that they’d be helping take care of someone where others can’t.\\n\\nSo knowing all this, I want you to appreciate the choice you finally got to make **now**. And I want you to be assured that it was the right one for you in this point of your life.\\n\\nI want you to enjoy college, try new things and fail and try again. Find that thing that makes you wake up and say “I can’t wait to do this today”. That’s where you should be because it will be your choice; no guilt, no shame. Go study, grow, learn to do the thing that others weren’t meant to do.\\n\\nKnowing you love your sister and want the absolute best for her - and knowing that you probably aren’t the one to provide that for her - is honestly a very selfless thing; it will save you and her a lot of resentment. But I also hope you are able to forgive your family - the hand they were dealt was a tough one, and I’m sorry they handled it the way they did. That wasn’t your sister’s fault and it wasn’t your fault.\\n\\nI hope this helps bring perspective and some comfort.', 'r/entitledparents r/narcissisticparents jesus christ dude this is not okay man... i wish i could do anything for you', 'How were you put on here to be her caretaker you were born first.

         "AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?",
         "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did.

Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to.

He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n\nAITA for this joke?",

Ye olde “two wrongs don’t make a right.” \\n\\nIt’s satisfying to think that this may have changed the way these customers behave, but ideally they would be reasoned with - not shamed/punished. I’m not sure if there’s a better way to teach lessons in civility or common decency, but just spit balling: having signs up that remind customers about the proper way to treat employees, treat customers like human beings and don’t coddle them (customer is always right does not mean let them get away with everything), having management mediate the situation by deescalating the situation and realizing there was an issue on both sides (cold coffee and poor behavior)...', \"ESH an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.  Usually people are just upset and are ranting because they had a shitty day outside the cafe.  Most people don't need more added stress.  Is it justified? Sure, but you can still be the bigger man in the situation.\", 'Wow this is gonna be a Hotspot for Karens who want you fired.', 'The boss of the shop I used to work in used to tell people that he would fire the employee and give them a huge gift certificate to \"apologize and make it right\".  Interestingly those people never used their free money or came in again to see we had not been fired.', \"YTA. I've worked for five years full time in a coffeeshop and I know how hard it can be. However, this is NOT how a business works. At all. You sound and act VERY young and from experience, I assume that your customers aren't nearly as bad as you make it sound.\", \"YTA, really sorry about this one OP. Because I think this is a very fun idea and with a real educating power for asshole customers.\\n\\nBut if I was a customer and I witnessed a manager firing someone like that, I would never come back because I don't want to give my money to shitty managers who mistreat workers. \\n\\nAs I would never come back, I wouldn't see that you weren't actually fired. \\n\\nOn the long term that will make the business lose money, so it is a real reason for the business owner to fire you. \\n\\nYou guys had your fun and that's a great story, but you should probably stop it quickly before James' dad hears about it.\", 'Of course it’s mean lol that’s the idea. Fuck those people they should leave feeling bad. I work in a coffee shop and will be showing this one to my coworkers. Keep your chin up', 'NTA but I would be careful. You may run into a real asshole that has no remorse and gets upset that you are working there the next day after getting fired', 'God damn this sub is a shithole now', 'YTA\\n\\nNot for tricking the customers but for how bad it makes the business look and I guarantee each of those people mentioned it to a bunch of others who now think the management of that place are complete assholes. \\n\\nIf the owner knew you and his own kid were doing this I guarantee you’re all fired for real.', 'Did the customer ever come back when you’re working again after that incident? I think it’s hilarious but I would feel awkward if he came back.', \"INFO:\\n\\nSo, what happens when one of these angry customers comes back and sees you working there still? \\n\\nIsn't there going to be a bigger issue when they realize they were lied to?\", \"Eventually, you'll probably find someone who takes that as reinforcing of their terrible behavior.\", 'YTA\\n\\nCustomers are sometimes shitty, but it’s your job to deal with them.\\n\\nThe fact you came up with this ‘prank’, and have done it multiple times, suggests you do need to improve the service/product.', 'YTA - Teaching people that their actions have repercussions =\\\\= teaching people that their actions have equivalent repercussions. This is unreasonable, I don’t know how big a deal a customer can make about hot coffee but likely not big enough to Warner a firing unless they specifically say so. You’re effective beating someone for doing something wrong that warrants a slap on the wrist.', 'jesus this is just childish...YTA', \"YTA, However, there are moments when being an asshole is appropriate and you are not in the wrong here. It was hilariously appropriate for the situation and plays well into the social roles.\\n\\nTechincally you're an asshole, realistically you're a comedian.\", 'ESH. I like being silly-petty too, i really do, but I know I\\'m an idiot when I do it even with friends. IF it was a one-off; hilarious. But you keep doing it, and eventually customers are going to catch on and realize you\\'re playing with people\\'s emotions, justified or not. Just let the game go now and leave it as a funny story for the future or else it\\'ll turn into an \"i got fired when I was younger for being stupid\" story . (I also assume ESH doesn\\'t mean \\'asshole\\' , just \\'sucky\\' ?)\\n\\nAlso, I wonder if you could rewrite this in a different format to fit r/MaliciousCompliance . Might not be the perfect fit, but it did remind me of it when I started reading  and they\\'re a bit more morally skewed like us there.
