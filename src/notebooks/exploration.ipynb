      "My daughter (17f) recently started dating this boy 17m. He is her first bf ever. One of my biggest concerns when my daughter started dating is her getting mistreated, an obvious concern. However, after meeting her bf at one of his baseball games (she met him trough one of her friends in baseball) I realized this was not something I had to be seriously concerned about. ..He is genuinely one of the sweetest people I have ever met. Every time I see him interact with the coaches, his teammates, his opponents, my daughter, etc. it is always positive. He is just generally a very soft-spoken and kind individual, always positive and happy. I also say this with no ill intent, but he is fairly short and somewhat tubby, which is relevant to my husbands opinion..I obviously do not care about this as he is a good person and quite clearly treats my daughter well. When my husband met him earlier however he did not seem as happy. ..Once he had left he told me that he don't think he was right for our daughter. He made comments about him not being man enough. I said that our daughter clearly loves him and he clearly loves our daughter, and that I'm happy she's with someone we know is going to treat her right. My husband said that he would rather her be with a \"real man\", not some short little gay kid. I got a little mad at this and said what would you rather have him be then? some big macho man that snaps at our daughter? He responded by saying that that would be better then some fat pansy...I told him he was just being an annoying dick to the kid for no reason other then he doesnt think hes \"man\" enough for some stupid arbitrary reason and that he should be supporting our daughter. He said if yout fine with our daughter dating a fucking pansy so be it I guess. He stormed off and I've been reflecting on it and think maybe what I said was uncalled for as he has his own perspective on these things as a dad, and I should not have started thrown around insults as that does nothing to fix this issue for our daughter and her bf\n",

That is wild to me - fathers are usually so protective and gooey with their girls and this one is like ‘I don’t care if he’s a good kid, impresses everyone around him, and treats my daughter like a princess, he’s not toxically masculine enough to date my daughter.’ You didn’t insult him by calling him a dick, you simply pointed out his immature behavior in a language he seems to understand better...You’re the asshole by trying to defend his behavior as a ‘perspective’ worth having because he’s a father? No. Quite the contrary. He shouldn’t have that perspective because he’s both a man and a father. And that’s scary. Y’all need to sit down and discuss wtf is going on and leave your daughter and her bf out of this discussion. It is not her problem or burden to deal with. She didn’t get to pick who her parents are, but you picked your husband. Make sure he doesn’t end up hurting your daughter’s feelings with his gross opinions.

I hate that your husband is more concerned about the volume of someone’s voice than the words they speak. I hate that he’d prioritize physique over personality. Sounds like he sure knows how to pick him - honestly out of everything, I think this is most offensive to you, his partner!!! NTA, you did the right thing in sticking up for your daughter. I’d maybe try talking to your husband about the bigger picture - chances are your daughter will date numerous people of all different shapes and sizes, and the most important thing is that you support her throughout her journey to find her person.\n",

      "NTA...I was about to say that maybe your husband is not properly expressing his feelings -which is still a possibility - but it's pretty bad to say that he'd rather your daughter be with some macho guy that snaps at your daughter than a less masculine looking dude. Jesus. And I'd much rather have a kind of dad that he's prepared to throw down if his daughter is mistreated. Now that's a real man (wonder how he'd respond to that)...Also there's a creepy undertone in his comment. He wants a 'real man'. But he's not the one sleeping with him, your daughter is (or will be and sorry for making assumptions here, you get my point I hope). What is it to him?..Antagonism aside...the possibility still remains that your husband is seeing something in the guy that bothers him or brings something up for him that is always worth exploring since you guys are a couple.What is he actually worried may happen ? Is he making some negative association with a certain type of men? Is he actually worried that the boyfriend is gay and is going to leave your daughter for a guy and break her heart (sorry I know this sounds ridiculous but this is the human mind we're talking about). Did he have some negative experience in the past with a guy like that? Is he insecure about his own masculinity in a way and how so?..Is it maybe some way to react against you and any persistent worry you may have about your daughter being mistreated? Is he worried about you guys mollycoddling her?..At the end of the day this could be an opportunity for you and your husband to understand each other better, and for him to understand himself. So rather than an opportunity for a schism you can treat it as an opportunity for deeper understanding...Obviously what matters for your daughter is that she is happy with whatever guy she chooses.\n",

Is treating people with kindness and respect while not quite being GQ cover material \"pansy\"? ..NTA, but it sounds like you're married to one. I'd definitely not apologize. He was absolutely being a dick, straight up. Don't let this go. ..The biggest role model for how a child ultimately chooses their future partner is their opposite sex parent.

      "NTA - But I do think this is far more about your husband than your daughter's boyfriend who is obviously an incredible person, as is your daughter for seeing someone's soul and choosing a partner based on their morals and temperament. .Men who make such comments about other men's looks and masculinity are often insecure about their own definition of \"manliness\" and they project it onto someone who has obviously been successful in finding a woman that the person insulting them seems to think deserves the best, and their understanding of \"the best\" male partner is challenged and this is a lot for very narrow minded people to deal with. .Nobody is \"wrong\" in this scenario, your husband was a bit of a dick, but this has obviously come from somewhere inside him that he needs time to grapple with. This is not you, your daughter's or even the boyfriend's responsibility to prove to your husband that he is worthy of your daughter or being a \"man\", rather it's your husband's responsibility to discover why he feels this way, and come to his own conclusions over time. My advice would be encouraging the relationship from your side as you have been, and make a point for all of you to ignore this kind of projecting behaviour from your husband until he either comes around, or wants to have an adult discussion about his perception of what a \"man is\" and why he may feel this way.\n",

I can say from first hand experience, there is NOTHING more important in a partner than how they treat you...Your daughter is lucky to have found someone who seems to respect her and treat her well and she is lucky to have a parent like you who will recognize that and stand up for it. Do not cave on this. You have the opportunity to make sure your daughter knows she deserves to be treated well by her partner.

We’re still doing that? Not for nothin’ but what did your husband look like at 17? I’m going to guess that it’s nothing like he currently looks. The kid is SEVENTEEN. He’s not even old enough to vote yet. He hasn’t finished growing completely! He still has baby fat on him. Or, he may look like this forever-maybe his parents are short and chubby-I have no idea. But aren’t we more concerned with his character than his appearance? Maybe he’s really great at math or engineering or something but soccer isn’t for him. He may have a medical reason for not being uber-fit. If your husband is worried about this kid being able to take care of your daughter, you probably need to point out that this isn’t medieval England and she doesn’t need a knight to defend to his death her honor-she needs a guy who can be a true partner, treat her with respect and be financially responsible, along with some other things. Having good pecs isn’t worth a whole lot. Obviously, your daughter thinks he’s fantastic, otherwise she wouldn’t be dating him. Realistically, she won’t be with him forever-we all know that. But your husband’s approach is pretty shitty. It’s a perfect way for him to push her away and also give HER a complex if she doesn’t look “perfect”. What if she comes home from her first semester of college having gained the “freshman 15”? Will her father say nasty things about that? If she gets acne? Doesn’t wear makeup? Never gets any taller?

      "In my experience, it’s the “fat pansy” or “short little gay kids” that understand and know how to treat their partners, gay or not. The “real men” who insult and put down others for no obvious reason other than their looks, have issues they need to deal with, and probably fear their own sexuality in the back of their head. ..Your daughter’s boyfriend is 17. He isn’t even fully grown, as men typically do not stop growing until they are 18, and many well into their 20s. Using his physical appearance as a reason to hate him or not want him with your daughter is completely asinine. What does it matter if he can sprint for a mile, bench 250, or any other arbitrary physical meter your husband would find fitting? Physical characteristics such as weight can fluctuate greatly. It can solely depend on diet, physical activity, body chemistry, sleep patterns, and genetics. The boyfriend is literally on the baseball team, so he is an athlete, and very clearly willing to do the work to stay on the team. They go through a lot of physical training and practice, they have to run… for all your husband knows, the boy has already lost a lot of weight after joining the team. ..Your husband clearly has issues, and he needs to reflect on his disgusting treatment of a child he barely knows. That is a huge red flag, and he seriously needs to get over his outdated idea of machoism.\n",

Your husband called him that cause he thinks being a loving, emotional person isn't \"manly'', isn't a \"big macho man\" as you called out and he agreed with. Thinks only a gay man is capable of that...I'm taking a *wild* guess that your husband doesn't act like this kid at all towards you.

      "Your husband acted uncalled for, and so did you.  It's something you can both talk about and move forward on. There is a value in a husband's intuition and he might be hiding some insight behind the insult. I'm sure he may have known someone in his past like your daughters boyfriend, and that person was a massive piece of shit and no one believed him, or something like that. It's worth discussing it and exploring it with him and seeing why he doesn't like this kid. If he talks through what he is frustrated about he may realize it's silly and move on, or even be able to offer some good advice about that kids character. Either way a real discussion from a point of trying to understand his position will allow you both to discover a better way to communicate stuff like this.\n",
